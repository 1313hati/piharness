# Progress

## M0: prove the base — DONE (2026-10-17)

**Implemented behavior**
- Single-package repo, strict TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`, `strict: true`), one lockfile.
- Pi pinned to exact `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.3.0`; lockfile committed.
- Local llama.cpp endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`, model `qwen38`) verified reachable and resolvable through `ModelRuntime.create({ refreshOnCreate: false })` → `getModel("local","qwen38")` (ctx=98304, max=8192). No secrets stored in project config.
- API assumptions verified against installed `.d.ts` files and recorded in `docs/upstream.md`. Two adapter bugs found and fixed: (1) `message_update` deltas are nested under `assistantMessageEvent`, not top-level; (2) `agent_end` is per-turn — `agent_settled` is the real run terminator.

**Commands/checks and outcomes**
- `npm run typecheck` → clean
- `npm run build` → clean
- `node --input-type=module -e "import { ModelRuntime } ..."` → provider `local` + model `qwen38` resolve ✓
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models` → qwen38 listed ✓

**Known limitation / blocker**
- None. Real-model smoke test passed (see below).

**Next action**
- M1: focused unit tests, then M2: task controller, state persistence, resume.

### M0 ticket 5 — real-model smoke test: PASSED (2026-10-17)

Command:
```
npx tsx src/cli.ts run "There is an off-by-one bug in src/sum.ts: ... Fix the bug ... then run 'npm test' to verify all tests pass." --cwd evals/fixtures/offbyone
```

Outcome: model performed read → edit (`i < n` → `i <= n`) → bash `npm test`; 3 tool calls, 24222 tokens. Final response reported all tests pass. Independently re-verified: `src/sum.ts` contains `i <= n` and `npm test` prints `ALL TESTS PASSED`. Local llama.cpp tool-calling works end-to-end through the harness.

## M1: useful agent — IN PROGRESS

**Implemented behavior**
- `src/cli.ts`: interactive session (readline prompt, `/quit`, `/cancel`, `/stats`), one-shot `harness run "task"`, `harness doctor` (node version, model resolution, local endpoint reachability, limits).
- `src/pi/session.ts`: `createHarnessSession()` adapter — the only module importing Pi APIs. Normalized event stream (`NormalizedEvent`), subscribe/unsubscribe, prompt/abort/waitForIdle, stats, last-assistant-text, dispose.
- `src/config.ts`: validated config with precedence CLI → project `.harness/config.json` → defaults. Fixed a bug: `await import("node:fs")` inside a sync function (TS1308) — now a static import.
- Streaming output: text deltas to stdout, thinking in dim, tool start/end with status, errors to stderr.
- Cancellation: SIGINT aborts the current run (one-shot exits 130; interactive cancels and continues).

**Commands/checks and outcomes**
- `npm run typecheck` → clean
- `npm run build` → clean
- `harness doctor` → not yet smoke-tested against the live endpoint (pending)

**Commands/checks and outcomes**
- `npm run typecheck` → clean
- `npm run build` → clean
- `npm test` → 19/19 pass (tests/config.test.ts: 5 tests — defaults, project overrides, CLI overrides, undefined-clobber regression, invalid-config rejection; tests/events.test.ts: 14 tests — per-turn agent_end dropped, agent_settled→agent_end, text/thinking delta extraction, wrong-shape delta dropped, tool events, retry, compaction, unknown dropped)
- Real-model smoke test: PASSED (see M0 ticket 5 above)

**Known limitation / blocker**
- `harness resume`, `status`, `memory`, `skills`, `eval` commands not yet implemented (M2+).
- `maxToolCalls`/`maxTaskMinutes` limits are parsed and reported but not yet enforced by a controller (M2).
- Interactive mode not yet exercised against the live model (one-shot path is proven).

**Next action**
- M2: task controller (`src/task/`), state persistence with atomic writes, resume with workspace reconciliation.
